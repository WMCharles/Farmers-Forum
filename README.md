# Farmers-Forum

## Introduction

Digital Farmers Forum is a website that is meant for farmers to help each other. Here, farmers post any problem that they might be facing in their day to day life and other farmers try to help them solve their problems. In addition, to helping each other solve problems, farmers can also share useful and meaningful information that might help other farmers. 

## Problem Statement

Most farmers face a lot of challenges in their day to day life as they go about their daily activities in their farms. For one reason or another, these challenges tend to consume a lot of their time and resources. This might be because they lack the knowledge of how to solve these problems or resources to get the necessary help.

## Features

* A landing page where farmers can access posts from other users
* JSON Server that will act as the database
* Forms that they will use to add their posts. In addition, they will also use the forms while responding to other users posts.
* Comments, like & dislike, and delete post functionalities.

## API
* The application will use custom JSON server instead of a third party API.
